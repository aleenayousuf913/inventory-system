This is the Python script I use to make doing inventory at Subway easier! It tracks deliveries, sales, and expiration dates (waste) to predict shortages. This program uses a sample data generator for demonstration purposes. Feel free to adapt this code to your specific restaurant needs.

Features
- track deliveries with expiration dates
- track sales and adjust inventory
- generates sample data
- reports low stock items and expired stock
